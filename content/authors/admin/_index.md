Isaac Ahuvia is a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Stony Brook University, studying under Dr. Jessica Schleider in the Lab for Scalable Mental Health. His research investigates how people understand mental illness (e.g., What causes depression? Am I depressed?) and the consequences of these understandings for mental health outcomes. He is also the creator and instructor of an undergraduate course on the social construction of mental illness. Prior to joining the Lab for Scalable Mental Health, Isaac studied sociology at the University of Michigan and conducted research at the University of Chicago Inclusive Economy Lab and Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
