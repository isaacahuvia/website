## Adolescents' beliefs about depression
Isaac and his collaborators have conducted research with help-seeking adolescents exploring their beliefs about what causes depression, how permanent depression is, and how these beliefs relate to clinical variables. [One study](https://psyarxiv.com/q43pd/) found that depressed adolescents who have more pessimistic beliefs about the duration of depression are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies. This work has also begun to [explore the factors](https://psyarxiv.com/yf6vq) that adolescents believe cause depression, as well as the importance of those beliefs. [Ongoing work](https://osf.io/mu2jr/) is examining additional beliefs (e.g., beliefs about what symptoms constitute depression), their stability, parent-child agreement, and more. 

## Body dissatisfaction and depression
Isaac has led [a meta-analysis](https://psyarxiv.com/6rycq) which found that interventions targeting body dissatisfaction in youth had significant effects on those youths' depression symptoms - even when this was not a target of intervention. This work has inspired a single-session intervention targeting both body dissatisfaction and depression in adolescents, which is under development.

## Additional research
Further projects have explored [machine learning approaches for treatment selection among single-session interventions](https://psyarxiv.com/nekhw/), [the potential of teletherapy to meet demand for mental health care among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://psyarxiv.com/8unfx/), and more.
