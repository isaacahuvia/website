## Adolescents' beliefs about depression
Isaac and his collaborators have conducted research with depressed adolescents exploring their beliefs about what causes depression, how permanent depression is, and how these beliefs relate to clinical variables. [One study](https://psyarxiv.com/q43pd/) found that depressed adolescents who have more pessimistic beliefs about the duration of depression are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies. This work has also [explored the factors](https://psyarxiv.com/yf6vq) that adolescents believe cause depression, as well as the importance of those beliefs. [Additional work](https://psyarxiv.com/hs98z) has examined the implications of adolescents' beliefs about what symptoms constitute depression. 

## Body dissatisfaction and depression
Isaac has led [a meta-analysis](https://psyarxiv.com/6rycq) finding that interventions targeting body dissatisfaction in youth had significant effects on those youths' depression symptoms - even when this was not a target of intervention. This work has inspired a single-session intervention targeting both body dissatisfaction and depression in adolescents, which is [under development](https://psyarxiv.com/4ywe5/).

## Additional research
Further projects have explored [machine learning approaches for treatment selection among single-session interventions](https://psyarxiv.com/nekhw/), [loss of mental health care among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://psyarxiv.com/48q7p) and [the potential of teletherapy to meet these new demands](https://psyarxiv.com/8unfx/), and more.
